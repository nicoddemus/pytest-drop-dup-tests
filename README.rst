A Pytest plugin to drop duplicated tests during collection.

Pytest by default will collect all tests from directories or files given
in the command-line. For example, if you execute::

    py.test tests/unit tests/

Tests from ``tests/unit`` will appear twice, because they will be collected
again when pytest sees the ``tests`` directory in the command-line.

This plugin is intended for the cases where the user wants to run all tests
from ``tests/unit`` first and then the rest of the tests under ``tests``,
without duplicates.

This plugin was born from the discussion taken in `#1187`_.
